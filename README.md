# Simple-calculator
A simple command-line calculator built using Java. This project performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input. It uses the Scanner class and switch-case statements, includes division-by-zero handling, and allows repeated calculations until the user exits.
